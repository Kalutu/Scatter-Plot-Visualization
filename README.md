# Scatterplot Graph
This is a scatterplot graph project that displays data about doping in professional bicycle racing. It uses D3.js to visualize the data and allows users to interact with the graph by hovering over data points to see additional information in a tooltip.

## Project Description
The scatterplot graph displays the relationship between the year and the time taken by cyclists in a race. Each data point represents a cyclist, and the color of the data point indicates whether there are doping allegations associated with the cyclist.

## Features
- Hover over a data point to display a tooltip with detailed information about the cyclist, including the year, name, time taken, and doping allegations (if any).
- The x-axis represents the year, and the y-axis represents the time taken in minutes and seconds.
- The graph scales dynamically based on the data to fit within the given dimensions.
- Data points are color-coded: orange indicates doping allegations, and green indicates no doping allegations.
- The graph includes axis labels for the x-axis and y-axis.
